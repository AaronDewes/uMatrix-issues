# uMatrix-issues

This is the official community-maintained [issue tracker for uMatrix](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uMatrix-issues/issues).

You can help the development of uMatrix by using the development build, in order to report new issues or regression bugs before stable releases of uMatrix are published.

Development builds:
- Chromium-based browsers: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix-dev-build/eckgcipdkhcfghnmincccnhpdmnbefki>
- Firefox: click the most recent `uMatrix.webext.signed.xpi` file from <https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases>

If you install a development build once, it will be automatically updated with a more recent development build version when a new one is published.

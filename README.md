Speculated performance issues will be marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data + analysis supporting the claim

You can help the development of uMatrix by using the development build, in order to report new issues or regression bugs before stable releases of uMatrix are published.

Development builds:
- Chromium-based browsers: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix-dev-build/eckgcipdkhcfghnmincccnhpdmnbefki>
- Firefox: click the most recent `uMatrix.webext.signed.xpi` file from <https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/releases>

If you install a development build once, it will be automatically updated with a more recent development build version when a new one is published.
